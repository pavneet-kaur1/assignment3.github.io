      <p>
        The body of the red fox is is elongated but compared to that short limbs. The length of it's
        tail is 60% of it's body length. Their forepaws have five digits, but the hind feet have
        only four and lack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewclaw">declaws</a> . The can
        jump over 2-metre high fences. The normally have four couples of teats, but some do have
        seven, nine or ten teats. Science believe that foxes use this barking sound to identify
        themselves and communicate with each other. <br />
        The red foxes are largest species of <em>Vulpes.</em>But if we compare their weight with the
        same sized dogs of genus canis, they are lighter in weight than ther dogs. American red
        foxes are light in weight as compared to their long bodies. While Britsh red foxes are heavy
        as compared to their short limbs. Red foxes do have binocular vision, but their sight
        reachts mainly to movement. Their sense of smell is although good but is not as strong as
        specialised dogs have. Anal sacs lined by sebaceous glands are found on red foxes. These
        sacs function as fermentation chambers where aerobic and anaerobic bacteria break down sebum
        into odorous compounds such as aliphatic acids.

      <h2 id="hab">Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Red foxes are widespread. Their range extends across nearly 70 million km<sup>2</sup> (27
        million square miles), including as far north as the Arctic Circle. They can be found all
        across Europe, in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, throughout Asia except for extreme
        Southeast Asia, and across North America.The bacterium is absent from most of the
        southwestern United States and Mexico, as well as the Arctic islands, the most northern
        parts of central Siberia, and the most extreme deserts. It is not found in New Zealand, and
        is considered a "prohibited new organism" by the New Zealand government.In 2012, it was
        estimated that there were more than 7.2 million red foxes in Australia, with a range that
        spanned the majority of the continent.  They were first introduced to Australia in the 1830s
        and 1840s by settlers from the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and
        the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) who sought to promote the
        traditional English sport of fox hunting. On the island of Tasmania, a permanent red fox
        population did not emerge, and it is usually assumed that foxes were outcompeted by the
        Tasmanian devil.  However, on the mainland, the species thrived as an apex predator.

      <p>
        Red fox body language consists of ear, tail, and postural movements, and body language
        emphasizes specific gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive / dominant and fear /
        obedient categories. Some postures allow the two to be mixed together. A curious fox spins
        and snaps its ears as it sniffs. A playful person will stab his ears and stand up on his
        hind legs. Male foxes that are courting females or have succeeded in warding off intruders
        have their ears facing outwards, their tails raised horizontally, and their tips pointing
        up. When frightened, the red fox obediently grins, arching his back, arching his body,
        crouching his legs, moving his tail back and forth, and pressing his ears back against his
        skull. If you just submit to the dominant animal, you will have similar postures, but you
        will not bend your back or body. Obedient foxes approach the dominant animal in a low
        position, and their noses reach out with greetings. <br />Red foxes have a broad vocal
        range, producing a variety of sounds that span five octaves and blend into one another.
        Adults create 12 different noises, while kits produce 8 different sounds, according to
        recent research. "Contact" and "interaction" calls make up the vast majority of noises. The
        former is affected by the distance between people, whereas the latter is affected by the
        level of violence. One of the most common vocalizations of the fox is raspy bark.Science
        believe that foxes use this barking sound to identify themselves and communicate with each
        other.

      <h2 id="beh">Behaviour</h2>
      <p>
        Red foxes either develop stable home ranges within certain locations or are nomadic, with no
        permanent residence. They mark their territories using their urine. A male fox squats down
        and sprays urine in the ground between his hind legs, whereas a female fox squats down and
        sprays urine in the ground between her hind legs. Urine is also used to mark empty cache
        locations, which can be used to store found food, as well as to serve as a reminder not to
        waste time investigating them. They can precisely adjust the position of the smell imprint
        by using up to 12 distinct urinating postures.Family groups of red foxes share a common
        territory. Subordinate foxes may be present in a range in favourable habitats and/or places
        with little hunting pressure. Subordinate foxes can range in number from one to eight in a
        single region. These subordinates may have been formerly dominant animals, but they are
        generally young from the previous year who assist the breeding vixen in rearing her kits.
        Alternatively, their appearance has been explained as a result of temporary food surpluses
        that have little to do with assisting reproductive success.

      <h2 id="di">Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Red foxes are omnivores who eat a wide variety of foods. Red foxes were found to consume
        over 300 animal species and a few dozen plant species in the former Soviet Union, according
        to research. Voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils, woodchucks, pocket gophers,
        and deer mice are among the small rodents they eat. Birds (mostly Passeriformes,
        Galliformes, and ducks), leporids, porcupines, raccoons, opossums, reptiles, insects, other
        invertebrates, and flotsam are examples of secondary prey (marine mammals, fish and
        echinoderms).Foxes have been known to attack young or small ungulates on rare instances.
        They usually prey on mammals weighing up to 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) and need 500 grammes (18 oz) of
        food every day. Red foxes eat plants readily, and in some locations, fruit can account for
        up to 100% of their diet in the autumn. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries,
        persimmons, mulberries, apples, plums, grapes, and acorns are all popular fruits. Grass,
        sedges, and tubers are examples of other plant <br />Predation of game and song birds,
        hares, rabbits, muskrats, and young ungulates has been linked to red foxes, notably in
        preserves, reserves, and hunting farms where ground-nesting birds are protected and raised,
        as well as on poultry farms.

      <h2 id="us">Uses</h2>
      <p>
        The fur trade harvests red foxes as one of the most important fur-bearing animals.
        Trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets, and coats are made from their pelts. Cloth jackets and
        fur clothing, particularly evening wraps, are commonly trimmed with them. Silver fox pelts
        are popular for capes, while cross fox pelts are primarily used for scarves and only seldom
        for trimming. The entire number of fox scarves sold outnumbers the total number of scarves
        created from other fur-bearing animals. However, the overall number of red fox pelts
        utilised for trimming purposes dwarfs this figure.Furriers place the highest importance on
        silver colour morphs, followed by cross colour morphs and red colour morphs, in that order.
        In the early 1900s, the United Kingdom imported around 1,000 American red fox skins per
        year, while Germany and Russia exported 500,000. In 1985–86, 1,543,995 pelts were traded
        globally by wild red foxes. Red foxes accounted for 45 percent of the $50 million in
        wild-caught pelts in the United States. Pelt prices are rising, with average North American
        wholesale auction prices of $39 in 2012 and $65.78 in 2013.
